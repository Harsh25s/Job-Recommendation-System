# JobRecommendation
Job Recommendation System - iNetworks Task

Given a job title, the system would recommend similar and related job titles, functions and industries.

Model used: TF-IDF
The system was deployed using Flask.
There is also an auto-complete feature where if the user enters a subset of the job title or mis-spelled a title, the system would automatically guess what the ser meant and act accordingly.
